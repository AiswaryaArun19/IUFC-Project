## Dataset
The dataset comprises 2240 rows and 29 columns, covering various attributes such as customer ID, birth year, income, household composition, purchase history, and campaign response indicators.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations like heatmaps and pair plots reveal patterns and correlations within the dataset.
2. **Clustering Algorithms**: K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN are utilized to identify distinct customer segments.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and elbow method are employed to evaluate clustering performance.
4. **Targeted Marketing Strategies**: Insights from customer segmentation inform the development of tailored marketing campaigns for each segment.

## Outcome
The project aims to provide actionable insights for businesses to optimize their marketing efforts, improve customer engagement, and enhance overall business performance. By understanding the distinct preferences and behaviors of different customer segments, companies can tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs of their target audience, ultimately leading to increased customer satisfaction and profitability.
